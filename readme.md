#Player 1 Turn

The time will begin when player 1 clicks the first tile. Only 2 tiles can be revealed at once. If the pair is a match the tiles will dispear from the board.

#Bad Pair
When a pair does not match the cards revealed will return back to their normal hiden state .5 seconds after being revealed. This is designed to allow the user to see the unmatched pair long enough to register its position on the board without permanently displaying its location. (Thus making it a memory game)
